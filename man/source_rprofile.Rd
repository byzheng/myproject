\title{Source the nearest `.Rprofile` from a directory tree}
\usage{
source_rprofile(start = getwd(), stop_at = "/")
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{Character scalar. Directory where the search begins.
Defaults to [base::getwd()].}

\item{stop_at}{Character scalar. Directory at which upward searching stops.
Defaults to `"/"`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path to the sourced `.Rprofile` file, or
  `NULL` if no `.Rprofile` is found. Side effects from `.Rprofile` are
  applied in the caller environment.
}
\description{
Starting from `start`, this function searches for a `.Rprofile` file in the
current directory and then each parent directory until `stop_at` (inclusive)
or the filesystem root is reached. The first `.Rprofile` found is sourced and
the search stops immediately. The file is sourced with `chdir = TRUE`, so
relative file paths in `.Rprofile` are resolved from the `.Rprofile` folder.
Objects created by `.Rprofile` are assigned into the caller environment.
